# placeholder1 (thinking "Reach" for the name, like the LLM support extends the developer's reach)
- One is just an assortment of code from the Noteable Genai repo that has some useful helper functions
- Two is the prototype build. 001.py runs as a standalone script but the configurable fields are spread all throughout.
- Three contains a first stab at a production build. Vectorstore.py needs to be fired up before pipeline.py can be run. The 003 notebook just hold some ideas and is more of a testing ground.
- The cmi_sleep_states is code for this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states. Current solution was created primarily by reach with the only manual change being the addition of one-hot encoding. The code needs some additional memory crunching support to pass the submission memory limit.
