- One is just an assortment of code from the Noteable Genai repo that has some useful helper functions
- Two is the prototype build. 001.py runs as a standalone script but the configurable fields are spread all throughout.
- Three contains a first stab at a production build. Vectorstore.py needs to be fired up before pipeline.py can be run. The 003 notebook just hold some ideas and is more of a testing ground.
- Everything is very rough
